# ConsensusLab

## Mission

ConsensusLab explores fundamental problems of control, coordination, and consistency in distributed systems.

## Goals

ConsensusLab’s vision is to be the go-to place for scalable decentralised consensus research. In the true spirit of Protocol Labs Research, we aim to become a hub for the collaborative advancement of human knowledge on this challenging topic. Together with a wide network of academic and industry partners, and in collaboration with other open projects, our team will be building an engine for the decentralised web.

ConsensusLab’s short to mid-term focus is on rearchitecting and implementing Filecoin consensus in a scalable way so it can be used in Filecoin, supporting current Filecoin actors and beyond. The project will not incrementally upgrade existing Filecoin consensus but re-implement consensus layer from scratch in a secure, modular, scalable and upgradable way.

## Research Endeavours

Our work is divided into three main areas. We have a tracking issue for each:
* [Blue: Hierarchical Consensus](https://github.com/protocol/ConsensusLab/issues/3)
* [Yellow: General Consensus Layer](https://github.com/protocol/ConsensusLab/issues/2)
* [Green: VM / Runtime](https://github.com/protocol/ConsensusLab/issues/1)
