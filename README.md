# ConsensusLab

## Mission

ConsensusLab explores fundamental problems of control, coordination, and consistency in distributed systems.

## Goals

ConsensusLabâ€™s short to mid-term focus is on rearchitecting and implementing Filecoin consensus in a scalable way so it can be used in Filecoin,supporting current Filecoin actors and beyond (supporting execution of different VMs and arbitrary code), i.e., in the larger blockchain ecosystem. The project will not incrementally upgrade existing Filecoin consensus but re-implement consensus layer from scratch in a secure, modular, scalable and upgradable way.

## Research Endeavours

See our [launch blog post](https://research.protocol.ai/blog/2021/consensuslab-supercharging-our-consensus-research/) for high-level information. We will be adding more information on open problems and active endeavours to this repository (as issues or code).

## Publications, Talks & Trainings
