# ConsensusLab

## Mission

ConsensusLab explores fundamental problems of control, coordination, and consistency in distributed systems.

## Goals

ConsensusLab’s vision is to be the go-to place for scalable decentralised consensus research. In the true spirit of Protocol Labs Research, we aim to become a hub for the collaborative advancement of human knowledge on this challenging topic. Together with a wide network of academic and industry partners, and in collaboration with other open projects, our team will be building an engine for the decentralised web.

ConsensusLab’s short to mid-term focus is on rearchitecting and implementing Filecoin consensus in a scalable way so it can be used in Filecoin, supporting current Filecoin actors and beyond. The project will not incrementally upgrade existing Filecoin consensus but re-implement consensus layer from scratch in a secure, modular, scalable and upgradable way.

## Research Endeavours

Our work is divided into three main areas. We have a tracking issue for each:
* [Blue: Hierarchical Consensus](https://github.com/protocol/ConsensusLab/issues/3)
* [Yellow: General Consensus Layer](https://github.com/protocol/ConsensusLab/issues/2)
* [Green: VM / Runtime](https://github.com/protocol/ConsensusLab/issues/1)

For each of our active projects, you'll be able to find resources, talks, demos, and notes from our weekly calls. If you're interested in joining any of our meetings, please reach out!

We also have a detailed [ZenHub roadmap](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/consensuslab-60f84a7fa2395a0011e4134c/roadmap?invite=true), which will give you a bird's eye view of all of our projects. If you install the [ZenHub browser extension](https://www.zenhub.com/extension), you'll have a much better time navigating this repo.
